# deep_learning: A Collection of Deep Learning Implementations in PyTorch

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts implementing various deep learning models and techniques using the PyTorch framework. Each script focuses on a specific concept or application, accompanied by a corresponding Markdown file providing details about the implementation, usage, and potential extensions.

The scripts are designed for educational purposes, providing hands-on examples of how to build, train, and evaluate deep learning models for different tasks. Each script should run independently.

## General Instructions

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.6+
    *   PyTorch (>=1.0)
    *   NumPy
    *   (Other dependencies may be required depending on the specific script; see the corresponding `.md` file.)

2.  **Installation:**
    ```bash
    pip install torch numpy
    # Install any other dependencies as specified in the individual `.md` files.
    ```

3.  **Usage:**
    *   Refer to the individual `.md` files for detailed instructions on how to run each script and interpret the results.
